Patient name:

John Doe

Medical Record Number:

123456789

Date admitted:

July 1, 2050

Date discharged:

July 3, 2050

Attending Physician:

Dr. Will Teachwell

Resident Physician:

Dr. Bea Goodoc

Diagnosis:

Left-sided systolic congestive heart failure
EF of 35% on echo performed 3 months ago

Other diagnoses:

Type 2 Diabetes
Stage 2 Hypertension
Osteoarthritis

History:
Mr. Doe is a 72 year old gentleman with a history of CHF who presented with a 3 day history of gradually
worsening lower extremity edema, weight gain, and shortness of breath. Today while trying to mow his
lawn he had to stop multiple times to catch his breath and developed some chest tightness leading him
to come to the emergency room. He denies any other decrease in exercise tolerance or chest pain
leading up to this event. He reports good understanding and adherence to his medications, but does
report that when his daughter was visiting town 4 days prior to admission that he and his wife took her
out for a special Mexican dinner and he indulged in several baskets of chips and salsa.
Problems:
1. CHF – On admission he had 3+ lower extremity pitting edema, rales from the bases to midlung
bilaterally, elevated jugular venous pressure and a CXR consistent with volume overload. He was
diuresed and was able to quickly wean off supplemental oxygen and exam revealed resolution of his
edema and rales at discharge. Discharge weight is 202 lbs. Given that dietary indiscretion led to the
exacerbation, it was not felt necessary to change his home diuretic regimen at this time. He was reeducated on diet and taking daily weights including information about weight gain that should trigger
him to call his primary doctor. He will follow up with his doctor at the end of this week for volume
reassessment and electrolyte labs.
2. Chest pain – due to chest pain while mowing, he was ruled out for an MI with serial EKGs and
enzymes. His EKGs remained unchanged from previous and his enzyme curve remained normal. Chest
pain was attributed to his hypoxia from his CHF and no further work-up was pursued at this time. On

follow-up, should readdress and make sure that he remains without change in his exercise tolerance and
remains pain free now that he is back to euvolemia.
3. Type 2 Diabetes – His HgbA1C was 7.3 which is good control for him at this time. No changes were
made to his diabetic regimen. On health maintenance questioning he revealed it has been 18 months
since his last eye appointment and we recommended he make an appointment as soon as he can get in.
4. Hypertension – Though initially elevated at the time of admission, his BP came down nicely with
diuresis and was 142/82 once euvolemic. In keeping with JNC-7 guidelines, we increased his lisinopril to
40 mg/day and his metoprolol to 50mg BID for optimal BP control given his diabetes. He resonded well
to this without complications and was 126/72 at discharge.
5. Osteoarthritis – His knee pain was well controlled with Tylenol prn.

Patient name:

Mary Malloy

Medical Record Number:

123456789

Date admitted:

July 1, 2050

Date discharged:

July 3, 2050

Attending Physician:

Dr. Will Teachwell

Resident Physician:

Dr. Bea Goodoc

Diagnosis:

Left intertrochanteric hip fracture

Procedure:

Left hemiarthroplasty

Orthopedist:

Dr. Cal Seeyum

Other diagnoses:

Post-op atrial fibrillation
Congestive heart failure – EF of 40% on echo May 2049
Coronary artery disease
Stage 2 Hypertension
Osteoarthritis
Osteoporosis

History:
Mrs. Malloy is a 83 year old woman who presented after slipping on the ice while trying to retrieve her
morning newspaper. She landed on her left side and had immediate left leg pain upon trying to rise.
Her neighbor noted her fall and called 911 when it was apparent she had been injured. She denied any
head trauma or loss of consciousness and no other injuries were found on full body assessment.
Problems:
1. Left intertrochanteric femur fracture – Patient underwent a left hemiarthroplasty on hospital day 1.
(Please see full Op note if further details desired.) Her post-p course was complicated by a two day
period of atrial fibrillation and volume overload as detailed below, but otherwise she tolerated the
procedure well. She started physical therapy POD #1 and has been progressing as expected. She will be
discharged to the TLC Rehab Center to complete her course of rehab with the goal of returning to
independent living. Her pain is currently well controlled on scheduled Tylenol as below with morphine
sulfate 30mg tablet given 30 minutes prior to her morning and afternoon therapy sessions. She will
remain on lovenox BID for DVT prohylaxis until she completes her therapy and is once again fully mobile.
The surgical site should be evaluated daily for signs of infection, though currently this has not been a

problem. If she continues to heal well, the staples need to be removed on July 12. She is scheduled for
follow-up with ortho A clinic as below.
2. Cardiovascular – At baseline she has fair exercise tolerance and has done well on her CHF regimen.
POD #1 she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and a medicine consult was
called. They adjusted her metoprolol dose and diuresed her with a resolution of her hypervolemia and
A-fib in 2 days. Due to her CHF and A-fib she was ruled out for a peri-op MI with serial EKGs and
enzymes. TSH was within normal limits. She is currently doing well and is considered to be euvolemic
with a weight of 146 lbs.
3. Osteoporosis – Mrs. Malloy has never received a Dexa scan, but was taking vitamin D and calcium
supplementation prior to admission, which was increased while here in keeping with new guidelines.
She has been referred for ongoing treatment of her osteoporosis and is scheduled to have a Dexa scan
on August 1 in the Bone and Mineral Metabolism clinic. We have deferred decisions re: bisphosphanate
therapy choices to their expertise.
4. Rehab/Functional Status – At baseline, Mrs. Malloy lived independently and was independent in all
ADLs. Her daughter assisted her with grocery shopping and transportation to events out of her
immediate neighborhood as she has felt less and less comfortable driving longer distances. Her MMSE
was 28/30 on this admission and she participated well in PT and OT – please see attached therapy
progress notes for specifics. It is expected she will need 2 more weeks of inpatient therapy to be able to
safely return home. At that time, we recommend a home safety evaluation by OT scheduled at a time
her daughter can also be present to assist in making her home less of a fall risk.
